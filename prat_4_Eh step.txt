1 :-##p/w encypt and decrypt using cryptool.##
>>open cryptool>>Click on File tab-> New, Type any text to encrypt .>>Click on Encrypt/Decrypt tab Click Symmetric (modern)RC4Enter any keyClick on Encrypt>>For Decryption again click on encrypt/Decrypt tab Symmetric(modern) RC4 enter same key  Click on Decrypt..

2.##Password Cracking and Wireless Network Password Decoding using cain and abel##

open cain and abel>>Click on hash calculator>>Write password in the text to hash field.and click on calculate.>>Copy hash value of  MD5>>Go to Cracker and select MD5 on the left side
Right click on screen and click on add to list>>Paste the previous copied hash value in the following box and click on ok>>Right click on last password and click on dictionary attack>>Right Click on Dictionaries and select add to list.>>Select wordlist file and click on open>>Click on start and we get the following output.>>Click on exit.

1.##Using TraceRoute, ping, ifconfig, netstat Command##

go in cmd>> type command  (tracert www.prestashop.com)>enter>Ping all the IP addresses.for example-the 1st ip of website like [91.240.109.42]>then go to vmware>open virtual machine -> Ubuntu-> terminalcommand-ifconfig>command-Netstat

2.## Perform ARP poisoning using cain and abel in windows.##
Download arpspoof.exe from http://bit.ly/RCEHARPSPOOF>>
Open command prompt as Administrator>>Delete all arp entries from the current machine arp -a -d .and ping the victim machine for exp- type comd -ping 192.168.121.1>> Now run the command arp –a and copy the MAC Address of the victim machine>>Open Wireshark and select the Interface from the menu Capture.Options… (and then click start) 
[Note: Make sure promiscuous mode is disabled. (This ignores traffic on the network which is not meant for the current machine]
 Copy the MAC address of the victim machine and add a display filter in Wireshark “eth.addr == 00-1c-c0-f2-f4-5a” eth.addr == 50-e5-49-1e-6d-1f>> Open browser on the victim machine and visit www.twitter.com>>Check Wireshark for any TCP entries on source machine. (You should not see any TCP entries)>> Stop capturing on Wireshark and check the entries. You should see TCP entries even though Promiscuous mode is OFF. This means the ARP spoof is successful.
